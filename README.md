# Bike-Sharing

## Overview
Last summer, my friend Kate and I took the trip of a lifetime. New York City for two full weeks exploring historic landmarks like Central Park, the Statue of Liberty, and the Empire State Building. It was a magical experience and as we flew home together we looked through our vacation photos and had a realization. One of the key ingredients to the magic was an unlikely suspect, Citi Bike. Kate and I had biked everywhere which allowed us to really get to know the city and interact with the people who lived there and who wer using bikes for their commutes. A gem of a idea starts to form in our mind. What if we could start a similar bike share business for our hometown of Des Moines Iowa. Kate and I start brainstorming and a few weeks later she calls you with some incredible news. She has a potential angel investor who might be interested in providing seed funding to explore a bike-share program in Des Moines. This is an exciting prospect but you know you have to think realistically. The mechanics of making this business work might be quite different in Des Moines than in NYC. You decide that the first step is to figure out how the bike-share business actually works in NYC. From there you will create a proposal on how it might work in Des Moines. Kate is gregarious, friendly, and fearless. She should definitely be the face of the proposal. However, I have the data analytics exoerience and you can take the lead on figuring out how this project might actually work.

## Purpose

In the past Kate and I used Tab


Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.
